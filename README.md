# MobstersDAO is here to exterminate!


Hey, take a look at LobsterDAO with all their nerdy glasses, big heads, bad posture and an ability to answer every blockchain-related question in the smartest manner. Have you seen their NFT commemorative drop?! This shit is ugly! We‚Äôre sick of it. No cap, we need something cooler‚Ä¶ Lobsters on steroids, Lobsters gulping down that mutagen cocktail, Lobsters looking contemptuously at all the other DAOs. Lobsters as it supposed to be ‚Äî chaddy, whaly, borderless group of elite crypto players. MobstersDAO.

## üç§ 1110b57e6da0 is coming üç§

Ascending that Metaverse trend we‚Äôve created an augmented fork with a ton of extremely awesome new attributes. Get the yellow legal pad, grandma, and start counting:

Total supply at the beginning: 555 NFTs (which is much better and more exclusive than 6571 boring jpegs)
Anthropomorphic features: Check (according to research by British scientists, faces evoke a much greater emotional response)
Mocking Ivan NFTs: Check (he is ngmi anyway)
Praising Cronje NFT: Check (but there are mocking ones too)
Mutants: Check (which is much cooler than regular crustaceans)
Cyborgs: Check (I‚Äôm not interested in anything that doesn‚Äôt have cyborgs)
Metaverse: Check (but we‚Äôll jump on the next trend as soon as it appears)

I urge all the LobstersDAO members to JOIN THE DARK SIDE!
Reject all the goofs! (or you can be a double-agent, we approve it*)

*In fact, we encourage it!

## How to get one
We have the most secure super legit system that you won‚Äôt be able to multiacc ‚Äî google form with a set of questions. The form is open for anybody who is interested, so go ahead, add your address there and participate in the distribution. Not all of the participants will get a share of the drop but only the ones who answer correctly...

## Why not make a drop to all the LobsterDAO NFT holders?
Pfff. It‚Äôs the fishing rod, not the fish. Whatever that means.

## Do MobstersDAO speculate on original Lobsters value?
No, it‚Äôs a different project made for fun the greatness while original Lobsters are boring af. There was no purpose to dilute the original Lobsters supply. They are pathetic anyway. Don‚Äôt consider it as NFT jokes and memes for the LobsterDAO community. Yes, original Lobsters NFTs are ‚Äúserious‚Äù ones in this regard, but they‚Äôre nerds.

## Royalties
Royalties are 5% from each sale and go straight to artists.

## Multisig
Multisig will be owned by several NFT community members. No idea who, send us your applications, we‚Äôll send it directly to a shredder. BUT! If you‚Äôre valuable to the project, you‚Äôll be rewarded with some more work because we don‚Äôt want to do it forever.

##Future plans and roadmap
Mint your NFT and have fun! Or don‚Äôt who tf cares. Also we want to encourage people to participate in the 1110b57e6da0 governance. So watch your step because we‚Äôre about to drop some knowledge. And the knowledge is in the fact that we‚Äôll reward those who believed.
